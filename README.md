# Cohere for PDF Document Analysis

**Leverage Cohere's Command R model and FAISS Efficient Similarity Search for PDF Document Analysis**

![](/images/cohere-logo.png)

Cohere's Command R is a family of highly scalable language models that balance high performance with strong accuracy. Command-R is a large language model with open weights optimized for a variety of use cases including reasoning, summarization, and question answering. Command-R has the capability for multilingual generation evaluated in 10 languages and highly performant RAG capabilities.

This project automatically deploys an application, loads vectors into FAISS vector store, and allows for interfacing with Cohere's Command R Large Languge Model (LLM) within CML. The project is designed to be deployed as an AMP from the Cloudera AMP catalog.

## Storing PDF Files / Populate FAISS with Embeddings

### GUI
Storing PDFs in FAISS (local to the project file system) can be done via the web application as shown below, or by the Python job in the following section. For the GUI, file uploads are limited to 200MB and allow you to manually select a new index in FAISS with descriptions for better cataloging.

### Automation with Python Job
Storing PDFs in the FAISS vector store done via the Python job need to have an index specified in the job. By default, we use "Default Index" and this can be changed by the user at any time. This job runs once as part of the AMP script to populate FAISS with sample docs. This (and any created index) may be removed via the UI if desired. It may also be used to add automation to the project for populating the vector store with new data on a schedule or periodically.

## Project Requirements
#### CML Instance Types
- NO GPU required for this given it interfaces with Cohere via API
- A minimum 2 CPUs and 8GB RAM are required for the project to complete its AMP setup steps.

#### Recommended Runtime
JupyterLab - Python 3.11 - Standard - 2024.05

#### Resource Requirements
This AMP creates the following workloads with resource requirements:
- CML Session: `2 CPU, 8GB MEM`
- CML Jobs: `2 CPU, 8GB MEM`
- CML Application: `2 CPU, 8GB MEM`

#### External Resources
This AMP requires pip packages and models from Cohere. Depending on your CML networking setup, you may need to whitelist some domains:
- pypi.python.org
- pypi.org
- pythonhosted.org
- cohere.com
- dashboard.cohere.com
- coral.cohere.com

#### Security Boundaries
By default, the application, the project files, and the vector store are entitled to the single project owner deploying the project or an ML Admin. 

**1. Securing project resources**

CML applications are accessible by any user with read-only or higher permissions to the project. The creator of the application is responsible for managing the level of permissions the application users have on the project through the application. CML does not actively prevent you from running an application that allows a read-only user (i.e. Viewers) to modify files belonging to the project.

**2. Public Applications**
By default, authentication for applications is enforced on all ports and users cannot create public applications. If desired, the Admin user can allow users to create public applications that can be accessed by unauthenticated users.

To allow users to create public applications on an ML workspace:
As an Admin user, turn on the feature flag in Admin > Security by selecting Allow applications to be configured with unauthenticated access.
When creating a new application, select Enable Unauthenticated Access.
For an existing application, in Settings select Enable Unauthenticated Access.
To prevent all users from creating public applications, go to Admin > Security and deselect Allow applications to be configured with unauthenticated access. All existing public applications will immediately stop being publicly accessible.

**3. Transparent Authentication**
CML can pass user authentication to an Application, if the Application expects an authorized request. The REMOTE-USER field is used for this task.
